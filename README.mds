# Vicara
Vicara test

The program is targeting an STM32L0201D4 Cortex M0+ microcontroller.
As minimal power consumption was of high priority.

CMSIS DSP lib is added from github repository.

Using stm32 stand by mode to minimize power consumption.
the MCU is woken up by RTC wakeup interrupt every 10ms to perform Naive Bayes classification
stand by mode is selected because it only consumes 0.10micro Amps when MCU is in stand by mode.
